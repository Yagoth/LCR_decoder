HELLO, WORLD! THE ENTIRETY OF THIS TEXT HAS BEEN ENCODED USING A SPECIFIC METHOD OF ALTERATION. THE ENDPOINTS OF THE ALPHABET HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH EXCLAMATION POINTS, WHILE EVERY OTHER LETTER HAS BEEN EITHER SHIFTED BY ONE OR LEFT ALONE (TYING IN WITH THE PUZZLE'S TITLE "LCR.") ONCE YOU HAVE ASCERTAINED EACH LETTER'S SHIFT, TAKE EVERY THREE LETTERS (AGAIN, IGNORING THE ENDPOINTS), AS TERNARY CODE. IF YOU ARE QUESTIONING HOW TO TRANSLATE EACH TYPE OF SHIFT, THEN REMEMBER A LEFTWARD SHIFT EQUALS NEGATIVE ONE, A RIGHTWARD SHIFT EQUALS POSITIVE ONE, AND CENTER IS ZERO. THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LOT OF WORK, BUT I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OF A JERK HAD I MADE THIS TRIPLY RECURSIVE. NOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS PAINFUL AS PLAYING THIS GAME!
